How to animate a 3D Cube with just HTML and CSS3

Core skill: add animations to divs using css3 keyframes and transforms.

### The HTML
The outer section holds a cube wrapper-div which has two parts: a text-div and the actual cube-div.
Inside this cube, there are six divs, representing the six individual sides of the cube.

### The CSS
To get to a real cube, we need to gie it some perspective.
Next we will spin this 360 degrees on the vertical, or y-axis.

Each individual side gets two css-stylings: a generic one applied to all sides and a specific one for each individual side.

### Extra
As an added bonus the logo text is animated as well, just like a typewriter.
